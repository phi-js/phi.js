Once more we sail by the Nor+thern gale
And boun+ding o+ver the main,
And now the hills of those tro+pic isles
We soon shall see a+gain.
Five hell+ish moons have waxed and waned
Since from the shore sailed we,
For now we're bound from the Arc+tic ground
Roll+ing down to old Ma+ui.

Rolli+ng down to old Ma+ui, me boys
Rolli+ng down to old Ma+ui
For now we're bound from the Arc+tic ground
Roll+ing down to old Ma+ui.

Through ma+ny a blow of frost and snow
And bi+tter squalls of hail,
Our spars were bent and our can+vas rent
As we braved the nor+thern gale.

And the horrid isles of ice cut tiles
That deck the Arc+tic sea,
Now lie ma+ny leagues as+tern
As we sail to old Ma+ui.

Rolli+ng down to old Ma+ui, me boys
Rolli+ng down to old Ma+ui
For now we're bound from the Arc+tic ground
Roll+ing down to old Ma+ui.

Oh welcome the seas and the fragrant breeze
That is laden with odors rare
And the pretty maids in the sunny glades
Who are gentle, kind and fair
And their pretty eyes look towards the skies
Hoping some day to see
Our snow-white sails before the gales
Rolling down to old Maui.
Rolling down to old Maui, me boys
Rolling down to old Maui
For now we're bound from the Arctic ground
Rolling down to old Maui.
It's a damn tough life of toil and strife
We whalemen undergo;
And we don't give a damn
When the gails have stoped
How hard the wind did blow.
We are homeward bound, 'tis a glorious sound,
On a good ship, taut and free
And we'll think of that as we drink and chat
With the girls of old Mohee.
Rolling down to old Maui, me boys
Rolling down to old Maui
For now we're bound from the Arctic ground
Rolling down to old Maui.
Rolling down to old Maui, me boys
Rolling down to old Maui
For now we're bound from the Arctic ground
Rolling down to old Maui.
